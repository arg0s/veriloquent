## The raison d'être

What better way to kick off a blog, but with a post that questions its very existence? This is an *open* thread for us to thrash out the raison d'être of this blog.

In discussions that [@justjots](//twitter.com/justjots), [@vinuthomas](//twitter.com/vinuthomas) and [I](//twitter.com/twitortat) have had so far, a few ideas have been tossed out.

## Sharing and Publishing

If we believe the Zuckerberg law will hold out nearly as long as the Moore's law has, we're looking at a future where people are going to be sharing much more than ever before.

### Zuckerberg's Law

> Every year, I expect that people will share twice as much online as they did the last year. [^1]
>
> Mark Zuckerberg, CEO of Facebook

Here are some common challenges we keep hearing about:

* If are a blogger or social media marketer, how do you keep up with the changing ways of reaching  your audience? 
* What are the most scientific approaches to sharing and publishing that can help ensure that you engage in your audience in an authentic, sustainable way?
* How do you analyze your traffic and reports to see what's working best and not?
* What are the different tools & techniques you use for sharing and publishing?
* Who are some of the industry experts? Is there a pay it forward[^2] system via which some of them may be willing to share their learnings with others?
* What are the ways this blog can *enrich* the learnings and experiences of other readers?

Do **you** identify with these? Are there **other challenges** you face as a blogger or someone who uses social media to share actively? **Chime in in the comments below.**
